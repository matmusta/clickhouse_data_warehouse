# Data Assets

- `tabular_events.csv` – Seed data for traditional MergeTree tables.
- `vector_items.jsonl` – Generated by `python/scripts/generate_vector_dataset.py` using the configured embedding model. Run the script after downloading models to produce this file.

The vector dataset is omitted by default to ensure it is created from the active embedding model, keeping schema and dimensionality aligned. Regenerate the file whenever you switch models or update the dummy text inputs.
